<h1>Video Still Life</h1>
<h2>What is a Still Life?</h2>
<p>A still life is an exersize commonly used by most artists to practice drawing or painting objects and people from life. Still lives typically consist of artsits stood and sat around a subject, which could be either objects, or people.</p>
<h2>The Assignment</h2>
<p>The assignment we were given was to set up a still life, specifically using a moving object and a reflective object, and record and edit together two 30 second long videos. After recieving this prompt, I chose to centre the still life around my turntable and record set up, naming it "Record Decor".</p>
<p>The still life consisted of:</p>
    <ul>- Record Player Whilst Moving</ul>
    <ul>- A Record On Top</ul>
    <ul>- <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/succulents-10309"target="_blank">Lego Cactus</a> </ul> 
    <ul>- A Figurine On The Record</ul>
    <ul>- The Record Cleaning Brush and Cleaning Solution</ul>
<p>Here is a behind the scenes image of the set up:</p>
